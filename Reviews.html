            <p>We often get people write in to tell us just how much fun they, and their family, had while visiting our show; heres some just below.</p>
            <p>“Hi Terry and Karen,</p>
            <p>ust a quick line to say thanks for a brilliant and well organized show. We raised £198-31 for the British Heart Foundation. We had loads of nice comments about our display; plus had a good time. Shame that I did not meet you both but I know that you were very busy. Once again many thanks for having us.</p>
            <p>Kind regards</p>
            <p>Pete Wheeler”</p>
            <p>“Dear Terry and Karen,</p>
            <p>I just wanted to say a big thank you for having the Mobile Ark to attend this years show.  We had a fantastic weekend. It seemed to be another busy 3 days, as was last years!  We brought our wallaby along this year and she proved to be a favourite for most people, along with the other animals – rabbits, guineas, chicks, ducks, hedgehog, tortoises,etc! The evening entertainment was great fun, and the whole show proved to be up to its usual standards of excellent organisation and great range of stalls and facilities. I would very much be interested in taking a stand at next years show, so please book us in for Rudgwick 2010!! Well done on another successful show this year and many thanks again.</p>
            <p>Regards, Imogen</p>
            <p>The Mobile Ark.”</p>
            <p>“Dear Show Organisers, We would like to send on our thanks for a great day out. We came on Sunday, what a pleasant supprise, could not believe the stuff that was there, so many different things for all the family. Excellent stuff, well done!</p>
            <p>Peter. Woking Surrey.”</p>
